#Slacker News

### Description
A fun little hacker news remake using the [hackernews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

### Build
This project uses a combination of methods below.
  - React 16
  - Eslint / Airbnb
  - JSDocs
  - MobX
  - React Router 4
  - Jest

### Contribution
To contribute to this hacker news remake the steps are very simple.

First if `yarn` is not installed, type:
`npm i -g yarn`

Once installed simply run these two commands.
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

ESLint runs on build, so if you fall out of line it will correct you the moment you save.

If you wish to run Jest snapshot tests, they can be run with:
`yarn test`

To reset the test snapshots run:
`yarn test:reset`

Enjoy!
